Museum exhibit using a JADAK 4-port RFID reader to read laundry tags in plush animals and display pretend medical imagery.

- Currently exploring read functions in exploration.py
- Test table of animal short names and pretty names in species.csv
- Plan to have folder of animal sounds and folder of animal images. Short names will match tag, sound, image.
