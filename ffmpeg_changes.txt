ffmpeg.py:982 has problems with the end of some videos, resulting in
an exception because video_packet has no attribute "image"
Make the following changes starting at line 982:

            if hasattr(video_packet, "image"):
                if video_packet.image == 0:
                    self._decode_video_packet(video_packet)
            else:
                print("Whoops, video_packet has no attr image. ffmpeg.py:986")

Adding the if hasattr() else print seems to fix it, for now :-)
